	<h2> Reflection: </h2>
	<p> Our game was pretty difficult for us being as smart as we are. We wanted to make something simple but unique at the same time. We had many errors, some would be easy to fix, and others would creat even more errors and make it more confusing. Trying to add some of our ideas we figured out that the game would be completely unplayable. Our most difficult part was trying to make sure everything ran smoothly. </p>
